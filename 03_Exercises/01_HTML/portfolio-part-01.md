# Community Project Website Exercise

In this exercise, you will be replicating the same website using different technologies.

We're going to build a web page that will showcase a community project.

## Pre-requisites

The minimum requirement for this exercise is basic HTML. However, the exercise can be done using any front-end technology.

You can refer to w3schools tutorials [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) in order to learn or verify the HTML syntax.

## Goals

- Create a proper web page using semantic markup and taking into consideration accessibility and responsiveness.
- Practice writing any front-end language you like
- **Pages**: 
  - <kbd>Home</kbd>
  - <kbd>News and Events</kbd>
  - <kbd>Contact</kbd>

## Instructions

- Run `git pull` inside your submission directory
- Install Visual Studio Code

### HTML PART I

In this part of the exercise, you will develop the three pages mentioned above using only HTML (no styling, no features): 
1. First come up with a community project idea and ways you can implement it. 
1. Create a **Home** page that explains your idea and how people can help.
3. Create a **News and Events** page with some events and news from your creation.
4. Create a **Contact Us** page that includes the contact info (phone number, email address, location) and a contact form
5. Create a **Menu** that can be used to navigate between the pages, and include it in all the pages
6. Commit ("HTML") 12 x ðŸ”‘

### CSS PART II

In this part, you will design the previously developed website
1. Change font families, font sizes, colors
2. Align the content of the pages and change width and height of each part
3. Add images and background images
3. Make it responsive!
4. Commit ("CSS") 12 x ðŸ”‘

### React PART III

Wow! You've reached this part, you must be good. Well, here's a hard one.

In this part, you will migrate the previously developed website from HTML & CSS ==> React
1. Use create-react-app command
2. For each part of the website, create a component. For example, if you have a header, slider, container and a footer in your hompage, each should be a component. You will find out here that one of the benefits of React is code reusability (ex. using 1 header code for all pages)
3. Use react-router to navigate between the pages
4. Commit ("React") 12 x ðŸ”‘
